### TODOS

In order to complete this test task and tiny pet-project, I am going to improve this repo with the following:

- Apply Mobile Figma designs to the Game page. Yet it is not styled.
- Add Adaptivity to fit for different screen sizes.
- Improve routing with error handling.
- Improve config to support multiple possibly correct values.
- Improve config to support multiple required correct values.
- Improve SCSS with reusable classNames or, maybe, mixins.
- Add Unit tests.
- Add Husky.
